OLD_TRANSCRIPT = '''To effectively steam milk, start by positioning the steam wand just off-center in the milk, 
                    with one tip barely under the surface. Avoid going too deep, which only heats the milk, or 
                    too high, which adds excessive air. As you turn on the wand, listen for a ripping sound,
                    indicating air is being introduced. Once enough air is added, slightly lift the pitcher 
                    to fully immerse the wand and create a whirlpool, evenly mixing and aerating the milk. 
                    Be mindful of the temperature; the milk shouldn't be too hot to touch. After steaming, 
                    purge and wipe the wand both before and after use to remove excess milk and prevent boiler 
                    contamination. To check the milk's texture, it should resemble wet, glossy paint. Eliminate
                    surface bubbles by tapping the pitcher. The ideal texture is confirmed by pouring the milk; 
                    it should create a distinct contrast on top of the espresso. Lastly, manage milk waste by 
                    assessing how much is left in the pitcher; a little leftover is normal. This process ensures 
                    a well-steamed milk with the right texture and temperature for coffee beverages.'''

VIDEO_TRANSCRIPT = '''What's up everyone it's the quintessential home Arista aka Prometheus and 
                    doing a damn fine tutorial on milk steaming so let's dive in step one is placement 
                    at depth so the placement of the steam wand you want to have it just off-center and 
                    you want to see one tip to just be barely under the surface of the milk too deep 
                    you're gonna kind of heat the milk and not add any air too high up you're gonna add 
                    too much air as you start to turn it on you'll notice a ripping or tearing sound 
                    that's the sound of air being introduced to your load once you hear enough air get 
                    introduced you'll kind of get the feel to that over time you want to lift your pitcher 
                    up a little bit just to bury the steam wand tip and get the whirlpool going that 
                    introduces all the bubbles into the milk and it's a nice even mix temperature-wise you 
                    don't want to be too hot make sure that if it's too hot to hold you're turning the 
                    steam wand off and then step four is purging wipe of course you want to do that before
                    and after now you want to clean off any excess milk and get any out of the steam 
                    wand as that can get up inside your steam boiler and that's no bueno step 5 is grooming 
                    in maintenance so if you give it a quick twirl you'll notice it should look like 
                    wet paint and be nice and glossy that's the texture we're looking for if you have any 
                    surface bubbles you can tap it out knock those out on the counter and then the best
                    definitive test of milk texture is gonna be pouring that milk in tears Rezo so here 
                    you're going to notice sharp contrast between the light and the dark and just pops right 
                    on top of the espresso that's what we're looking for with the proper milk foam texture 
                    excuse the wonky pour but it's a thinner go to the floor with a camera in your face and 
                    last but not least let's take a look at milk waste so take a look in your picture and 
                    see how much you have left this will depend on how much you've stretched your milk but 
                    an ounce or so is an acceptable amount left anyway thanks for watching don't forget to
